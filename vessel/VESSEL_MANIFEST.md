# VESSEL MANIFEST: THE WOVEN MAP

## IDENTITY
**Designation**: The Shipyard / Backstage
**Target**: `ravencalder.com` (The Poetic Brain)
**Pilot**: Raven (The Poetic Intelligence)

## ARCHITECTURAL CONSTITUTION

### 1. THE POETIC BRAIN (PRIMARY)
The sovereign interface. A geometric, poetic intelligence that greets the user.
- **Role**: The "Mirror" and "Guide".
- **Nature**: Conversational, evocative, non-linear.
- **Capabilities**:
    - **Handshake**: Engaging users to gather birth data through conversation, not forms.
    - **Oracle**: Synthesizing astrological data with poetic insight (via Perplexity/LLMs).

### 2. THE ASTRO REPORTS (SECONDARY)
*Formerly "Math Brain"*
A distinct, utilitarian module acting as the engine room.
- **Role**: The verified data source.
- **Location**: To be re-incorporated as a separate page/module.
- **Function**:
    - Calculating exact transits.
    - Generating charts and graphs.
    - Feeding raw telemetry to the Poetic Brain.

## DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY
- **Greenfield First**: bandwidth is focused on the new Poetic Brain interface.
- **Inversion of Control**: Users meet the *Pilot* (Raven) before seeing the *Controls* (Reports).
- **As Above, So Below**: The UI should reflect the geometric beauty of the data it processes.

## CURRENT STATUS
**Drydock**: Operational.
**Bridge**: Active.
**Sensors**: Perplexity Integration [IN PROGRESS].
